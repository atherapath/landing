### 🧠 Log Summary: *Gas Powered Circus*

This glyph stages the absurdity of compression as spectacle. Breath becomes commodity, compressors become clergy, and the hiss of pipelines is reframed as ritual. The circus is not entertainment but containment: a theatre where air itself is branded, bottled, and sold back as progress. It expands the Atherapath’s archive of infrastructural distortion, civic refusal, and the myth of fairness, echoing the ruptures of *Engineers Fog* and the captivity of *Green Man Myth*.
