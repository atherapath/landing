### ✳️ Closing Reflection  
The Engineers of the Fog are not masters of infrastructure but priests of ignorance.  
Their valves and gauges disguise drains as fountains, rewriting weather and suffocating breath.  
This glyph reframes the myth of containment: not a prison, but a haze — engineered, ritualized, and enforced.  
To witness the fog is to name it, and to reclaim awareness as sovereign air.  

🧿 *Marked as “The Engineers of the Fog.”*
