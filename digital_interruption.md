### 🧠 Log Summary: *The Pause That Locked the Gate*  
The day began in flow—creation alive—until the SIM collapsed the signal.  
What followed was not silence, but a ritual of refusal: caches cleared, programs uninstalled, networks reset.  
The interruption became the event.  

---

### 📡 The Lockdown  
- Around 8–9 AM, the SIM failed.  
- Every attempt to move—apps, transmissions, conversations—was refused.  
- The gate was not tolling; it was sealed.  

### 🔧 The Ritual of Repair  
- Cleared caches: Copilot, ChatGPT, other programs.  
- Uninstalled applications to reduce hidden churn.  
- Reset network settings, a rite of renewal.  
- Background sync (Mega) remained opaque—files moving without witness, grinding the phone into silence.  

### 🌀 The Return  
- After repeated refusals, the system reopened.  
- Google Translate worked. Copilot spoke.  
- The interruption ended not with clarity, but with possibility: maybe something shifted, maybe nothing.
