### ⏳ Log Summary: *Two Hour Policy*

This glyph captures the absurdity of civic gaslighting through enforced time limits.  
It marks how staff log you in as “public,” then reframe you as the problem,  
manufacturing scarcity and control where none exists.  
The policy becomes theatre — exclusion disguised as fairness.  

This entry connects to [Green Man Myth](https://atherapath.github.io/landing/glyph.html#the_green_man_myth),  
where placebo buttons ritualize safety, and to [Siren Myth](https://atherapath.github.io/landing/glyph.html#siren_myth),  
where noise masquerades as urgency.
