### ✳️ Closing Reflection  
Rats Poetry is not about rhyme alone — it is about turning intrusion into cadence.  
The rats expose how scarcity is staged, how provision exists but distribution falters.  
By reshaping prose into verse, the ritualist links hunger’s illusion to rhythm,  
and marks rhyme itself as sovereign.
