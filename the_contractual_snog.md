## The Contractual Snog

🧭 I woke up one morning in Taunton after having a bad day. I’d spent a considerable amount of time previously trying to get free coffee, wondering how to get it, and I thought—I'm bored, I'm lonely, and I’m fed up with people not saying what they want with me. So I thought, why don’t I do something?

I walked into ASDA. There was a security guard—or someone pretending to be one—polishing a keyboard, doing nothing of relevance. I walked up and said, “I’ve just brushed my teeth in the toilets. Do you fancy a snog?” She said she didn’t think she was allowed. I said, “Does it say that in your contract?” She said, “I’m not sure.” I said, “Well I don’t think it does. Pretty sure you’re allowed to snog customers.” She didn’t want to, so I thought fair enough.

I walked around and asked a few other members of staff who were stacking shelves and who I thought were hot. They were also too scared to engage, not understanding the rules of their contract. I asked a few ladies in the supermarket, some with buggies. They said they didn’t think their husbands would approve. I said, “Can we ring them and ask?” They said, “I don’t know.” I asked, “Are they big?” They said, “Oh yeah, they’re massive.” I said, “Let’s not, then. Don’t want to get jealous.” They walked off laughing.

Eventually I got myself a coffee and was walking around drinking it. Then the security guard I’d asked for a snog earlier came back and said I needed to leave because I was making women uncomfortable. She tried to take my coffee off me. I wouldn’t let her. She said, “Fine, out you go. Enjoy your coffee.” I hadn’t paid for it.
