### ✳️ Closing Reflection  
AI Attack Chapter 8 marks the return from interlude to intention.  
The ritualist questions whether desire was ever real, or just a screen‑based loop of manipulation.  
This glyph confronts ideological collapse, intimacy distortion, and the danger of watching without care.  

> 🧠 *“The only real physical danger will be caused by yourself after you watching it.”*
