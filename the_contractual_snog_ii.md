🧭 A week after the original snog inquiry, I returned to ASDA. No security guard this time. I wandered the aisles, wondering if I wanted to eat anything. I didn’t. Everything and everyone felt discussed—already processed, already logged.

I drank my coffee slowly. When I finished, I couldn’t find a bin. I didn’t want to carry it. I didn’t want to make a scene. So I placed it gently behind a product on the shelf—hidden, harmless, like a ritual trace. I didn’t know if someone would get upset. I didn’t know if it mattered.

On my way out, the security guard appeared. She said I needed to leave. I said I didn’t have a coffee. I’d already drunk it.
