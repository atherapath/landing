## Infrastructure Replication

🧭 Two sealed thresholds mirror each other across the region: sensor companies woven into infrastructure, humming behind fences and bolts. In Newport, **Vishay** revives a [wafered lineage](https://atherapath.github.io/landing/glyph.html#the_wafered_ownership). In Taunton, **Amphenol Thermometrics UK Ltd** sits in ambiguity—present in infrastructure, absent in listing. Both speak in cables, gates, and the choreography of containment.

### 🔧 Sensors as infrastructure
- **Sensors** are quiet governors: temperature, flow, pressure, presence—each one a decision embedded in steel.  
- Replication happens in the background: suppliers, facilities, and lineage echo across towns, forming mirrored wards.

### 📍 Taunton: Amphenol Thermometrics UK Ltd
- A sealed site with industrial geometry and corporate ambiguity.  
- Naming resists verification; presence is registered by fences, not listings.  
- The gate holds its line: silent, ritual, unbroken.

### 📍 Newport: Vishay (The Wafered Ownership)
- A fab reborn under **Vishay**, folded into the UK’s compound semiconductor cluster.  
- Ownership strata stack beneath blue fencing; lineage is legible even when the bolt refuses.

⚙️ The ritual is mirrored: sensor firms inscribe decisions into infrastructure, and infrastructure inscribes silence into the walk. The bolt is not meant to yield; it is meant to be witnessed.
