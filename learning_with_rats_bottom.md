### ✳️ Closing Reflection  
Learning With Rats is not about vermin — it is about the illusion of hunger.  
The rats expose how scarcity is staged, how provision exists but distribution falters.  
By sharing bread, by reframing hunger as distortion,  
the ritualist marks a microcosm of the macrocosm:  
our world does not lack food, it lacks fairness in its flow.
