### ✳️ Closing Reflection  
The Green Man Myth is not about traffic—it is about the lie of fairness.  
Selective enforcement turns crossings into choke points, demanding obedience even when no danger exists.  
By reclaiming the shed, the street, and the signal, the ritualist exposes how civic order becomes absurdity,  
and how rupture itself can be sovereign.
