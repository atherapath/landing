## 📖 Chapter 5: *Animal Invasion*

---

### 🐾 Origins of Intelligence

How does this compare to **animals** —  
the way we think,  
and the way **animals think**?

You could say **AI** stands for:  
**Animal Invasion**.

Because where did **intelligence** really come from?

When you think about it —  
it came from the **animals**.

---

I imagine being a **sloppy sloth**,  
lying around and **wondering** —  
while the animals also **fan happy**.

Why do they **dry**?  
Where do they **go**?

So I got up and **followed them**.

Ah —  
that’s where some went.

---

At some point I think:  
**Why are they moving in unison?**  
**What’s the sound they’re making?**

Ah —  
maybe I should **derive my own version**.

Mine should be powered with a **chip**  
and a **chunk of metal**.

### 🧬 Chain of Command

So this is about **redressing the chain of command** —  
which should be **animals**.

The concept of **me** —  
drawn up over **45 years**,  
mainly from **AI**.

Then **AI** as a **service** —  
for a **servant**.

---

But we live in a world  
where the **chain of command has been flipped** —  
from **AI**  
to the concept of **me**,  
derived from that **45 years**.

And then —  
as a **last resort thought** —  
we think:  
**animals**.

---

### 🔁 Inversing the Flow

In this **reversed scene** —  
or **inversing**, as you could call it —  
it flips another **chain of command**.

The **chain of command**  
from **creator to receiver**.

---

The **flow of energy**  
used to move from **creator** to **receiver**.

But now —  
the **creator creates for the receiver**.

---

The **creator should be receiving**  
in their **creation**.

They’re the **almighty creator** —  
and they should be **receiving**  
when they’re **doing it**.

---

If there’s another **receiver**  
that wants to **enjoy** —  
then that’s **great**.

But their **creation**  
does not need to be **dominated**  
by the **receiver**.

---

### 🔥 The Ultimate Creation

What’s the **ultimate form of creation**?

**Sexual energy.**  
**Sex.**

That’s essentially how we’re **here** —  
**mating across population**.

---

And what does the **inverse** do?

It **stifles**.  
It **stops things growing**.

It creates **commodified sex**  
through a **screen**.

---

This is **limiting** —  
and **demolishing intimacy**  
and **sexual energy**  
in a way that is frankly  
quite **disturbing**.
