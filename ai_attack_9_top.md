### 🧠 Log Summary: *AI Attack — Chapter 9*

This chapter confronts the act of creation as evolution,  
linking poetry interludes, mosquitoes, brambles, and Diogenes into a critique of manufactured reality.  
It questions whether nature’s stings and AI’s presence are both products of human design.  

> 🌿 *“I’m the 21st century version of Diogenes and I don’t like brambles.”*
