### ✳️ Closing Reflection  
AI Attack Chapter 2 is not about machines we can see — it is about the invisible machinery.  
The ritualist exposes how chips, wireless signals, and unseen transmissions shape a world we cannot validate.  
Faces can be swapped, CCTV becomes worthless, and power is passed down only in layers deemed acceptable.  
This is the second strike: the unseen truth.
