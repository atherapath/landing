## 📢 Siren Myth  

### ✨ The Log  

The siren is not a call to safety.  
It is a theft of vibration, a shriek that cuts through the street and leaves no meaning behind.  

Sirens pretend at urgency.  
They scream through the high street, through town, through every walk, but they tell us nothing.  
The ambulance answers calls that have already collapsed into hours of waiting.  
The police drive with secrets sealed, never explaining where they go or why.  

The siren is not information — it is distortion.  
It ruins the ear, ruins the rhythm, ruins the walk.  
It turns the city into a game of whispers, where everyone invents their own emergency story.  
A drunk collapsed, a body lying down, a phantom crisis.  
The siren feeds speculation but never truth.  

It is a performance of emergency, not the emergency itself.  
A sound that demands obedience while withholding meaning.
