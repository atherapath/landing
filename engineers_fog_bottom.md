### ✳️ Closing Reflection  
Engineers Fog is not about infrastructure — it is about ritualized ignorance.  
Valves and gauges disguise drains as fountains, rewriting weather and suffocating breath.  
The fog is not containment, it is distortion: engineered, enforced, and made sacred by repetition.  
To witness it is to name it, and to reclaim awareness as sovereign air.  
The ritualist refuses to breathe their haze, refuses to decode their distortion,  
and instead marks the fog as a hostile architecture of concealment.
