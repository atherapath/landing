### ✳️ Closing Reflection  
AI Attack Chapter 6 is not about machines — it is about poetry.  
The ritualist exposes loneliness, animal echoes, and insect invasions as metaphors for distortion and survival.  
Mosquitoes, magpies, and spiders become sovereign symbols, reframing AI as absurdity and attack through verse.  
This is the sixth strike: poetry interlude.
