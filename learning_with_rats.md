# Learning With Rats

This time last night, there were rats under my bed —  
running about, making a hell of a racket,  
arguing with each other, fighting with each other  
for a loaf of bread that I had next to me in my bed.  

Now these rats are ballsy little b******,  
because they know that I haven’t got much light,  
and they know where they can and can’t go,  
and I can’t see them.  

They are literally coming into the little hut that I’m in,  
jumping away on a bit of bread through the plastic —  
a whole loaf of bread — and then fighting each other.  

I’m thinking surely they can’t be that hungry.  
So I start making myself a sandwich with the other loaf of bread I’ve got,  
which I’ve put a board over the top of so they can’t get.  
I make myself a sandwich with salmon,  
and then I just start chucking slices of bread out.  

I make a nice little pile.  
In the morning it was gone,  
and I didn’t hear any more complaining.  

When I left this morning to go about my day,  
I chucked another three slices out there.  
It looks like they’ve just been circling around,  
jumping out every now and then, just thinking:  
“oooh great,” just doing that.  

And I thought: this weird problem we’re having here  
is not a hunger problem.  
The illusion of hunger doesn’t exist, because I’m filled up.  
I’ve got two loaves of bread.  

Frankly, would I share a bit of bread with any animal  
struggling in the physical, wanting to eat to the point  
where it’s gonna tear something of the same look as it to b****** shreds to get it?  
I don’t care. I’m not that hungry.  
I’ve still got provision to buy more food.  
So have some bread.  

And I think: that is like a microcosm of the macrocosm.  
Because we don’t have a problem with scarcity or lack of food.  
Our problem is distribution —  
and understanding how to distribute it safely and awarely to everyone,  
so nobody’s hungry.
