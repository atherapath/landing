### 🧠 Log Summary: *The Mirrored Delay*

This log links two sealed sites—Newport’s Wafer Fab and Taunton’s Alleged TT—through the lens of infrastructural recursion. Though separated by geography and sector, both sites manifest the same industrial geometry: gates that never open, ownerships that shift, and latent power sealed in steel. The glyph proposes a mirrored delay—where one site trails the other, repeating its pattern at a different time.

This entry expands the Atherapath’s map of recursive infrastructure and staggered industrial hauntings.
