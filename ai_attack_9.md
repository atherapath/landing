## 📖 Chapter 9: *Creation and Confrontation*

---

What's the poetry interlude  
really an interlude?

So what we're talking about here  
is the act of creation  
which is essentially evolution

And when you think about it  
what is evolution?

Well —  
you could say evolution and the concept of it  
is based on interspecies rape

And I don't know  
where robots come into that

---

Because the poetry Interlude spoke about the little busy bee  
and if you read it carefully  
it's a story of evolution  
and the birth of the mosquito  
who is destined to fly straight to your face

In a world that we have manufactured for ourselves  
where everything is manufactured by human design —  
how we live  
how we perceive  
how we act  
and what we engage in

We have created a reality  
where you're outside in the sun  
and Britain for too long  
and out the rain  
mosquitoes will fly straight to your face  
constantly  
and try to sting

---

And what does a mosquito sting feel like?  
Feels a bit like a bramble sting.

And what we find —  
if you try and sleep at night outside  
around a load of brambles  
mosquitoes.

And I don't know how brambles link the equation of mosquitoes  
but it's possibly they thrive off the same type of gas  
that is being generated around them.

And brambles are constantly trying to attack me  
when I walk through the woods.

I'm led to believe  
they don't move quick enough  
to actually be able to attack me  
but they always do.

Doesn't matter how many there are  
they always find me.

I don't like brambles.

Diogenes — the great philosopher —  
used to live outside with the dogs  
masturbating and pissing on the street  
opposing Babylon.

And when the king came and asked him for philosophical advice  
he said:  
**Get out my sunlight.**

Well —  
I'm the 21st century version of Diogenes  
and I don't like brambles  
stealing sunlight  
spiky and horrible  
killing trees.

But they're part of our world.  
We put them there  
with all the gassy atmosphere that we create.

Like AI —  
we put it there.

And people say:  
“Well they're coming in from abroad,  
coming in with the foreigners, blah blah…”

They come from a plant.  
They won't survive in this country without a plant.  
Without a bit of fluff  
they won't breed in this country  
without a bit of fluff.
