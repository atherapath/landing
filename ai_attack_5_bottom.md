### ✳️ Closing Reflection  
AI Attack Chapter 5 is not about machines — it is about origins.  
The ritualist exposes how animals embody intelligence, how chains of command are inverted,  
and how sexual energy as ultimate creation is commodified and stifled through screens.  
This is the fifth strike: animal invasion.
