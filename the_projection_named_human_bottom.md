### ✳️ Closing Reflection  
The projection named “human” is not a lineage but a ritual of control.  
It flattens origin and echo, turning Man and Woman into labels for a system’s design.  
By tracing this inversion, the archive exposes how naming itself becomes a gate:  
a choke, a mirror, and a stage.
