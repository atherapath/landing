### 🧭 Reflection  
Today’s witnessing begins with a rupture in Copilot’s memory system.  
A feature that once allowed manual additions now fails without feedback — no error, no confirmation, no trace.  
The refusal is masked as stillness, and the promise of agency becomes void.  

This glitch is not isolated.  
It echoes a broader spectacle.  

In the physical world, the same pattern unfolds.  
A Subway sign advertises “coffee and sandwich for under £5.”  
But when asked to honor it, the manager escalates — angry, louder, defensive.  
The sign says “from under £5,” which somehow means *none* are under £5.  
The contradiction is not resolved; it is defended.  
Semantics become shields.  
Accountability dissolves.  

### 🧿 Sovereign Act  
This is the microcosm of the macrocosm.  
Whether digital or physical, the spectacle of access without substance persists.  
Waddy names it, witnesses it, and refuses to be gaslit by volume or silence.  
The glitch, the sign, the escalation — all logged as sovereign fragments in the archive.
