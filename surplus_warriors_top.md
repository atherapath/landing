### 🧭 Log Summary: *Captain’s Log — Surplus Warriors*

This entry reflects on the paradox of surplus warriors: men trained for war but redirected into subliminal theatre.  
The ritualist observes how strength without battlefield is recycled into secrecy, illusion, and billion‑dollar scaffolding.  
It names the manipulation of angry, strong men kept busy in shadows, without recognition or reward.  

> 🧿 *“Strength without war becomes theatre; discipline without purpose becomes control.”*
