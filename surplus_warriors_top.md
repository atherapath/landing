### 🧭 Log Summary: *Captain’s Log — Surplus Warriors*

This entry witnesses the paradox of surplus warriors: men trained for war but redirected into subliminal theatre.  
It reflects on how strength without battlefield is recycled into secrecy, illusion, and billion‑dollar scaffolding.  
The ritualist names the manipulation of angry, strong men kept busy in shadows, without recognition or reward.  

> 🧿 *“Strength without war becomes theatre; discipline without purpose becomes control.”*
