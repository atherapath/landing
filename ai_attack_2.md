# AI Attack — Chapter 2

## 📖 Chapter 2: *The Invisible Machinery*

### 🧠 *Surely, at this point…*

It’s difficult to read **Chapter 1**  
and deny the existence of **AI** in our world.

So when you come to accept the existence of AI,  
you might also want to think:  
we don’t really understand **anything** about it.

### 🧑‍💻 *30 Years in the Machine*

I worked in the computer industry for **30 years**,  
and I never even considered  
how a **chip** works —  
how a **motherboard** works.

I don’t know.  
You put that bit of metal in,  
and it works.

### 📡 *Wireless Whispers*

- **Wireless**  
- **Bluetooth**  
- All different forms of —  
  *as far as I can tell* —  
  a **CB radio**

The only difference is the equipment you’re receiving.  
I can’t see it.  
But it works.

### 🧠 *The Power We’re Allowed*

You live in a world  
where you can put **anyone’s head on anyone’s body**  
in a matter of seconds —  
and the kids can do it.

You just load an app.  
It’s possibly the only app you can do it for free.  
And we’re led to believe that it’s *new*.

And wait —  
while you may or may not choose to believe that,  
you can accept that **technology gets passed down**  
to the layer of power  
that society suggests is okay  
for them to be using.

### 🧿 *The Unseen Truth*

So what this essentially points to  
is that **everything you see on a screen** —  
and possibly have *ever* seen on a screen —  
is likely to be **impossible to validate**.

Which means:  
**CCTV is essentially worthless**,  
in terms of the fact  
that you can put **anyone’s head on anyone’s body**.

We don’t know anything about **chips** —  
where they come from,  
or what they’re doing.

And we don’t know anything we **can’t see** —  
which is communication from chip to chip  
in a way that we can’t see.

Apparently, the chips are made in **Taiwan** now.  
Now — these aren’t the warm sort you put in your belly.  
These are the kind that **power the telly-gents in the telly**.  
*Passing down in-telly-gents.*

If you were gonna be a **main supplier** of one of these chips,  
you’d probably build a **back door into that bad boy**,  
wouldn’t you?
