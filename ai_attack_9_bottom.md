### ✳️ Closing Reflection  
AI Attack Chapter 9 reframes creation as confrontation.  
Mosquitoes, brambles, and AI are all seen as products of human manufacture,  
symbols of irritation, intrusion, and distorted evolution.  
The ritualist invokes Diogenes to oppose Babylon and sunlight theft,  
marking brambles and AI alike as unwanted but inevitable presences.
