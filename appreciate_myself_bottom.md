### ✳️ Closing Reflection  
Captain’s Log: Appreciate Myself marks independence and technical mastery.  
The ritualist reframes publishing as a sovereign act, with glyphs uploaded and linked without gatekeepers.  
This log is a reminder of self‑appreciation and inversion of traditional publishing power.  

> 🧭 *“Every glyph, every ritual, every link remains mine.”*
