### ✳️ Closing Reflection  
AI Attack Chapter 7 is not about coincidence — it is about algorithmic intimacy.  
The ritualist exposes how surveillance desire grafts faces onto screens, how longing is detected,  
and how the pub becomes a glyph of mirrored attention.  
This is the seventh strike: the face behind the bar.
