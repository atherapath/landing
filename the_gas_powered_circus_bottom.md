### ✳️ Closing Reflection  
The Gas-Powered Circus is not a show but a ritual of captivity.  
Compression becomes currency, and the hiss of pipelines replaces the rhythm of lungs.  
By staging this absurdity as spectacle, the glyph exposes how civic order disguises containment as progress.  
To witness the circus is to refuse its tickets, to reclaim breath as sovereign.
