### ✳️ Closing Reflection  
Two Hour Policy is not about time.  
It is about exclusion disguised as fairness, sabotage disguised as procedure.  
The system logs you in as public, then reframes you as a nuisance.  
Staff pretend to help, then whisper to managers who arrive already charged with suspicion.  
You are not the problem — they manufacture one.  
Nobody else uses the computer. The library is shut three days a week.  
And yet they need something to fix, someone to correct, a ritual to perform.  
So what’s the difference — psycho or idiot?  
At this point, being kind or understanding isn’t an option anymore.  
The ritualist refuses to be contained by their theatre.
