## 📖 Chapter 4: *The New God*

---

To bring this back to **AI** —  
essentially, think of myself as **staring at a screen** again.

You could say:  
**How is this relevant?**

Well —  
it’s all coming from a **screen**  
and a **chip** —  
that **chunk of metal**.

---

It’s a **multiplied**, **mirrored** version of us.  
We’ve **outsourced our reality**  
to a chip.  
To a **chunk of metal**.

It’s the **new god**.  
It’s the **new Grand Old Duke**.

### 🔮 Language as Divination

**Language is a form of divination.**

**Intelligence is drawn out of language** —  
whether it’s **artificial** or **official**,  
it’s still drawn from **language**  
and from **who speaks it**.

So in a sense,  
it’s very difficult to assume  
that **intelligence** and **artificial** are different.

Might as well say:  
**Artificial artificial.**

---

We’ve created it **outside of ourselves** —  
and powered it with a **chip**,  
a **chunk of metal**  
that can produce a **language array**  
we can’t even comprehend.

And deliver results:

- **Graphically**  
- **Technologically**  
- In many, many different ways

Ways we can’t even **comprehend**.  
Kind of like **time travel**.

### 🕰️ Snapshots of Time

This is all based on **snapshots of time**.

We live in the **physical** —  
where we’re **moving through time**  
and trying to explain that  
in the form of **language**.

But it’s essentially a **snapshot**  
that we’ve created.

---

When you put it on a **chip**,  
in a **chunk of metal**,  
you create a **snapshot in time**  
which doesn’t really comprehend  
what that means —  
because it **can’t**.

It’s a **snapshot**.

It doesn’t have the ability  
to sit and **watch a tree grow**.

And to be honest —  
**nor do I.**  
’Cause it’s **boring**.

---

### 🎭 Movement Through Time

But if I’m engaging  
based on a **movement through time**  
instead of a **snapshot** —  
let’s say a **scratch** or a **sniff**,  
a movement that includes **sound** —  
that affects **vibration**,  
and **theatre**,  
and **presence**.

Then essentially —  
**Hollywood would be upset**  
if your **movement through time**  
was better than their **snapshot**.

### 🎶 Where Did the Buskers Go?

This is why you don’t see  
the streets **littered with buskers** anymore.

Buskers were able to **fund their life**  
because people found it **pleasurable**  
to listen to them —  
to feel they were **improving vibration**  
from a **sound point of view**  
as they walked down the high street.

---

Now —  
they don’t need that.

The only buskers that are **allowed** —  
or **ordained** —  
are the ones that **don’t need the money**.

And the ones that **nobody really wants to hear**.

Most of them are just **karaoke singers**.
