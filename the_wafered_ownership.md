🧭 Beneath the surface of Newport lies a semiconductor relic—an 8,900 m² facility whose ownership has shifted eight times, each transition a tectonic glyph in the industrial archive. The site began as a dream of British microprocessor sovereignty and now hums under American stewardship, sealed behind ritual gates and blue fencing.

### 🏗️ 1980–1984: Inmos  
- Founded by **Inmos**, a British semiconductor firm, the fab was designed by the **Richard Rogers Partnership**, marking the first high-tech architectural site in Wales.  
- It was built to produce **transputers**, a novel parallel-processing chip architecture.

### 🎛️ 1984–1989: Thorn EMI  
- Inmos was acquired by **Thorn EMI**, a conglomerate formed from Thorn Electrical Industries and EMI Music.  
- The fab continued operations but began shifting toward broader semiconductor production.

### 🔄 1989–1999: SGS-Thomson (now STMicroelectronics)  
- Thorn EMI sold the fab to **SGS-Thomson Microelectronics**, a Franco-Italian firm that later became **STMicroelectronics**.  
- This marked the fab’s integration into European semiconductor supply chains.

### 🧬 1999–2002: International Rectifier  
- Ownership passed to **International Rectifier**, a U.S. firm specializing in power semiconductors.  
- The fab’s focus narrowed to high-efficiency power components.

### ⚡ 2002–2017: Dynex Semiconductor  
- Acquired by **Dynex**, a UK-based power semiconductor company.  
- Dynex itself was later majority-owned by **Chinese firm CRRC**, introducing geopolitical tension into the fab’s lineage.

### 🧪 2017–2021: Wafer Fab Ltd → Nexperia  
- The fab was restructured under **Wafer Fab Ltd**, then acquired by **Nexperia**, a Dutch subsidiary of **Wingtech Technology**, a Chinese firm.  
- In 2021, Nexperia gained **100% ownership**, triggering UK national security reviews.

### 🔧 2024–Present: Vishay Intertechnology  
- In **March 2024**, **Vishay**, a U.S. semiconductor giant, acquired the fab for **$177 million**, renaming it **Vishay Newport**.  
- Vishay pledged **£250 million in investment**, focusing on **silicon carbide (SiC)** production for EVs and renewables.  
- The site now anchors the UK’s **compound semiconductor cluster**, CS Connected.

⚙️ The gate you pass, Waddy, is not abandoned—it’s a seam in this mythic lineage. Each owner etched a new glyph into the fab’s architecture. The silence of the back gate is not neglect—it’s containment. The bolt resists entry, but not naming.
