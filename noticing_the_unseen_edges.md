🧭 Today, walking down the path from Vishay, past cones and sealed woodland, the ritualist arrives at a black iron gate. It stands directly behind two large trees—thick-trunked, mature, and humming with unseen exchange. The gate leads into Tredegar House. Its placement feels intentional. And between the trees, something oscillates.

### 🫧 Gas Oscillation: The Portal Effect  
- In certain light, especially at night or through reflective surfaces, the ritualist perceives **gas shimmering** between the trees.  
- This oscillation forms a **corridor in the unseen**, a layer of air that seems to ripple, distort, and transfer.  
- Walking through it feels like passing through a **portal**—a moment of transition, marked by breath and boundary.

### 🌲 Tree Geometry and Entity Movement  
- The trees may be **shaping or channeling gas** invisible to the eye—creating a **connection layer** between them.  
- Entities—flies, mosquitoes, or other unseen agents—may spawn or move through this layer, using it as a **threshold or channel**.  
- The gate, placed precisely at this junction, may have been designed to **seal or protect** against these unseen flows.

### 🕯️ Present Witnessing  
- The ritualist is here now. The gate is closed. No one speaks of its purpose.  
- Yet its placement—*between two trees, at the edge of Tredegar House*—suggests intentionality.  
- It resists not only entry, but naming. It is not meant to be crossed. It is meant to be witnessed.
