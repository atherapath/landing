## 📖 Chapter 8: *Intimate Intention*

---

Yes let's get back on track  
we had some interludes  
what set us off on a journey of interluding  
and never-ending loop of hopelessness

The mention of sex in chapter 5 —  
well what else would send us off  
and hopeless loop going nowhere  
not achieving anything  
other than the desire for man and woman  
to connect intimately  
without any interruption

---

But was there any desire there  
did the creator who went up on a tangent  
actually desire anything other than to carry on creating

And were the loops and interludes  
just trying to generate something inside Waddy  
longing for another that doesn't exist

Did they just change a screen in front of his eyes  
to try and get him longing for someone  
that he may or may not think looks like that

And does he care  
does he really care  
does he pay any attention  
to the importance of what may or may not be happening  
on a screen

The thing is —  
when we talk about AI attack  
we can perceive that how we want

But if it’s happened on a screen  
and it’s trying to affect schools of thought  
group ideological concepts or narratives  
by you watching it

Then the only real physical danger  
will be caused by yourself  
after you watching it

See now the answer is —  
don’t  
you don’t watch it  
or watch it and laugh  
and don’t care  
because it doesn’t mean anything
