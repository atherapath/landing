## ⏳ Two Hour Policy  

### ✨ The Log  

Two hour policy is not about fairness.  
It is about gaslighting — logging you as public, then reframing you as a nuisance.  

The staff member smiles, pretends to help, shuffles behind you all day.  
Her only act of relevance is to whisper to the manager.  
The manager arrives already charged with suspicion,  
telling you “Right, you don’t have a card, you need to log on with that.”  

But you have done nothing wrong.  
It was their staff who logged you in.  
It was their system that created the problem.  
And now they demand obedience, as if exclusion is fairness.  

Nobody else even uses the computer all day long.  
The library is shut three days a week anyway.  
They are making a problem out of the only person who actually cares about using it.  
So what’s the difference — psycho or idiot?  
Both create problems where none exist.  
And at this point, being kind or understanding if they are idiots instead of psychos isn’t an option anymore.
