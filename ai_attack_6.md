## 📖 Chapter 6: *Poetry Interlude*

---

**Homeless on the streets**  
Alone and watching time go by  
Falling deeper into loneliness  
No matter what I try

**Categorized as crazy**  
And sectioned off as strange  
The intimacy I crave inside  
Is always out of range

They tell you how to live your life  
They tell you how to think  
And if you pull yourself together  
You can even have a drink

**What if I don’t like to drink**  
Like the way I currently think  
I like peace and quiet  
Retreating to the birds 🐦  
**Following the glow of trees 🌳**  
**Leaving the absurds**

---

**Now’s the time to raise your head**  
Look up at that sun in the sky ☀️  
Who’s that flapping with all the skills?  
It’s little miss magpie 🐦

The feeling of together  
Without a word spoken  
The recognition that something here  
Is maybe just a bit broken

The holding of my tears  
The resting of my gaze  
Attending to my loneliness  
In the everlasting days

---

And the little busy bee 🐝  
Will fly around with glee  
It likes to buff the fluff  
Like a child f***ing its teddy

It buffs the fluff  
And away their fluff  
Will fly right by  
Gassy motorway —  
I’ve seen it with my eye 👁️

---

But what is most concerning  
And possibly disturbing  
Is the ones —  
That at the core of them  
Have a little black gassy fly 🦟

It floats around  
Above the ground  
Right in front of me

And it makes you wonder —  
If life’s a blunder  
Or is that mosquito coming from me? 🦟

---

The spider web is empty 🕸️  
Just fluff for me it seems  
But what am I to do  
With this little black gassy fly? 🦟

Well —  
I’m the spider 🕷️  
And you’re the driver  
And you created it for me

So here’s a present:  
The shooting pheasant  
A mosquito 🦟  
At a different air consistency

---

If you insist on being so gassy  
It’s going to attack ya  
It’s gonna fly straight at ya

Outside, out the rain 🌧️  
Would you like a little pain  
While mosquito gets inside ya? 🦟

It’s always gonna come for you  
It doesn’t matter what you do

Like a bat with big eyes in chase 🦇  
Waiting for the perfect moment  
To fly straight at your face
