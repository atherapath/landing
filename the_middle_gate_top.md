### 🧠 Log Summary: *The Middle Gate*

This entry maps the unseen checkpoint between creation and motion —  
the place where a work stops being yours and becomes subject to permission.

It is not the art or the wall —  
it is the turnstile that decides if anything moves.

Like a currency transaction, the gate profits not from wealth itself,  
but from the instant of transfer — the pause between ledger A and ledger B.  
Like a digital transmission, the gate does not care about the content,  
only the passage from *0 → 1*, the flicker where motion becomes commodity.  

The Middle Gate is the ritual of that in‑between:  
a choke disguised as protocol,  
a toll disguised as progress,  
a pause that becomes the product.
