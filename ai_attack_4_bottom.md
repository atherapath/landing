### ✳️ Closing Reflection  
AI Attack Chapter 4 is not about technology alone — it is about worship.  
The ritualist exposes how chips and screens become the new god, how language divines intelligence,  
and how snapshots collapse against movement through time.  
Buskers fade, vibration is ruined, and Hollywood resists rupture.  
This is the fourth strike: the new god.  

> 🎭 *“Hollywood would be upset if your movement through time was better than their snapshot.”*
