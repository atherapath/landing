### ✳️ Closing Reflection  
AI Attack Chapter 3 is not about proof — it is about collapse.  
The ritualist exposes how screens generate unverifiable worlds, where identity, time, and place dissolve.  
Hollywood becomes the stage of distortion, rewarding lookalikes and erasing skill into seconds.  
This is the third strike: the screen and the head.
