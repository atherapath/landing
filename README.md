# GLYPH ENGINE — landing/
One HTML file. Infinite pages.

glyph.html is the universal entry point into the AtheraPath content system.

Every “page” in this realm is actually a glyph — a Markdown file with a name. You don’t create pages anymore.  
You summon them.

---

## How it works
Just call:

glyph.html#slug_name

And the engine will automatically load:

- slug_name.md              ← main content  
- slug_name_top.md          ← optional banner/header  
- slug_name_bottom.md       ← optional footer text  
- slug_name.jpg             ← auto image detection  
- slug_name_2.jpg  
- slug_name_3.jpg  

No page duplication.  
No routing files.  
No build step.

## Example
[Projection Named Human](https://atherapath.github.io/landing/glyph.html#projection_named_human)  
Replace the hash with any Markdown filename (without .md).

---

## Philosophy
Slug the name.  
Land the glyph.  
Content lives as Markdown.  
The engine handles everything else.

---

## Why this exists
Traditional web publishing forces you to:

- create a page,  
- wire routes,  
- duplicate structure.  

Here, content is primary, and the structure emerges automatically.

---

## Markdown = truth
- glyph.html = portal  
- the repo = the realm  

---

## Naming Convention
Files discovered automatically when the slug is used:

- slug_name.md  
- slug_name_top.md  
- slug_name_bottom.md  
- slug_name.jpg  
- slug_name_2.jpg  
- slug_name_3.jpg  
- slug_name.mp4

## Project status
✅ Engine functional  
✅ Hash routing  
✅ Dynamic banners + slideshow + video detection  
⬜ Optional: auto-linking between glyphs  
⬜ Optional: menu / index page generation

This is not a website.  
It’s a publishing ritual.  

---

### Mythic Database Engine  
The GLYPH ENGINE is more than a portal — it is a **mythic database engine**.  
Every slug is a record.  
Every link is a thread.  
Every glyph is both content and schema, weaving structure and meaning into one inseparable fabric.  

By summoning glyphs instead of creating pages, you are not just publishing —  
you are weaving a sovereign archive where the database itself becomes myth.  

---

## Example Glyphs
Here are some glyphs already alive in the archive:

- [Projection Named Human](https://atherapath.github.io/landing/glyph.html#projection_named_human)  
- [Gas Powered Circus](https://atherapath.github.io/landing/glyph.html#gas_powered_circus)  
- [Engineers Fog](https://atherapath.github.io/landing/glyph.html#engineers_fog)  
- [Green Man Myth](https://atherapath.github.io/landing/glyph.html#green_man_myth)  
- [Digital Interruption](https://atherapath.github.io/landing/glyph.html#digital_interruption)  

Each one is a thread in the mythic database engine — enter anywhere, and the weave carries you forward.
