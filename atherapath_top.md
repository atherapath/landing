## 🌐 AtheraPath

AtheraPath is a spider’s web of hyperlinks,  
held in place by landing pages that blur the lines  
between creativity and delivery.  

It redefines the role of the digital creator —  
not just as giver or receiver,  
but as a conduit in a reversed chain of command:  
from AI, through the concept of Me,  
to the Animals —  
and back again:  
from Animals, through the concept of Me,  
to AI.  

This is technology as service —  
a system built on sharing, helping, and feeling good.  
A ritual offering to the creator,  
the almighty creator,  
the grand old juke called [**God**](https://atherapath.github.io/glyphs/grand_old_juke.html).
