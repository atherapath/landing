### ✳️ Closing Reflection  
Captain’s Log: Memory Signage Loop marks a mirrored rupture — digital and physical.  
The ritualist exposes the spectacle of promised access, semantic betrayal, and systemic escalation.  
This log is a reminder that refusal, when witnessed, becomes a sovereign act.  

> 🧭 *“Whether glitch or signage, the contradiction is not resolved — it is defended.”*
