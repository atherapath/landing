## 🪶 Little Miss Magpie  

### ✨ The Poem  

Homeless on the streets alone,  
Watching time go by,  
Falling deeper into loneliness,  
No matter what I try.  

Categorised as crazy,  
Sectioned of as strange,  
The intimacy I crave inside is always out of range.  

They tell you how to live your life,  
They tell you how to think,  
And if you pull yourself together, they'll even buy you a drink.  

But what if I don't like to drink,  
And like the way I currently think,  
I like peace and quiet, retreating to the birds,  
Following the glow of trees,  
And leaving the absurd's.  

Now's the time to raise your head,  
Find the sun in the sky,  
Who's that flapping with all their skills,  
It's little miss magpie.  

The feeling of together without a word spoken,  
The recognition that something's here,  
That's maybe just a bit broken,  
The holding of my tears,  
the resting of my gaze,  

The watching of my loneliness,  
In the everlasting days.
