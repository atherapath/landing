### 🧠 Log Summary: *The Green Man Myth*

A rupture in the street and a reclamation in the woods. This log captures the moment Spencer (Waddy) confronted the myth of pedestrian obedience and the absurdity of selective enforcement. The cry, the shout, the shed—each marked as sovereign. The entry echoes broader themes of the Atherapath: ritual error, infrastructural distortion, and the reclamation of agency through sound, solitude, and sovereign toys.
