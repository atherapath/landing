### ✳️ Closing Reflection  
AI Attack Chapter 1 is not about machines alone — it is about distortion of agency.  The ritualist exposes how systems weaponize procedure, reframing human error as machine inevitability.  Language becomes mind control, theology becomes screen-fed, and whispers multiply into digital recursion.  This is the opening strike: the unheard signal.
