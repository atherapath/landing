## 🕸️ Slug Web Audit Workflow  
*A living guide for maintaining the archive’s sovereign link structure.*

### Step 1: Identify Orphans  
- Any slug with **no inbound link** → mark it.  
- Add a “way in” from a thematically related glyph so it doesn’t float alone.  

### Step 2: Check Outbound Links  
- Every slug should point to at least one other glyph.  
- Preferably three, so the weave feels rich and non‑linear.  

### Step 3: Replace Placeholders  
- Swap ghost names (e.g., “Gas Powered Prison”) with canonical glyphs (*The Engineers Fog*).  
- Ensure strict naming convention: slug name, title, and link all match.  

### Step 4: Balance the Weave  
- Make sure no slug only points outward without being pointed to.  
- That keeps the circuit alive — no dead ends, no one‑way exits.

### ✳️ Result  
You’ll end up with a **sovereign spider’s web of slugs**:  
- Every slug is a knot.  
- Every link is a thread.  
- The archive itself becomes a mythic fabric, not a list of files.

## 🔗 Link Behavior

- All glyph links default to opening in the **same tab**.  
- Links must use the full absolute path:  
  `https://atherapath.github.io/landing/glyph.html#name_of_slug` 
 
- Users who prefer a new tab can right‑click or use browser shortcuts.  
- This preserves freedom of choice: the weave offers threads, but the reader decides how to follow them.
