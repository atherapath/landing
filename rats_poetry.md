# Rats Poetry

Ballsy little f****** rats, bold in the night,  
they move through the shadows, they dodge from the light.  
Into the hut, through the plastic they tear,  
a loaf in their claws, a fight in the air.  

Surely not hunger, I thought as they came,  
their racket and quarrels a ritual game.  
So I made me a sandwich, with salmon and bread,  
while chaos and squeals kept circling my head.  

I tossed out some slices, a pile on the floor,  
by morning it vanished — no quarrels, no war.  
Three more in the daylight, I scattered with care,  
the rats kept on circling, leaping from lair.  

And I thought of the world, of hunger and need,  
how scarcity’s myth is a dangerous creed.  
We don’t lack provision, the food is in place,  
it’s fairness and flow that we struggle to face.  

So I shared with the rats, let the bread find its way,  
a microcosm of macrocosm’s play.  
For hunger’s illusion dissolves when we see,  
distribution’s the key to set bodies free.
