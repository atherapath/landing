### 📢 Log Summary: *Siren Myth*

This glyph captures the rupture of vibration through the sound of sirens.  
It marks how noise is framed as safety but delivers only distortion.  
The siren becomes a performance of urgency, withholding meaning and feeding speculation.  

This entry connects to [The Green Man Myth](https://atherapath.github.io/landing/glyph.html#the_green_man_myth),  
where ritual buttons echo placebo safety.  
It also resonates with [The Engineers Fog](https://atherapath.github.io/landing/glyph.html#the_engineers_fog),  
where distortion conceals truth behind systemic noise.
