## 🔁 How It Flows

1. A Glyph Is Born — a simple Markdown file paired with an image (and sometimes a video).  
2. It Takes Shape — through Page-Weaver, rendered into a page alive with motion and meaning.  
3. It Connects — hyperlinks branch out, pulling readers into other glyphs,  
   and thus the Path grows.  

There is no algorithm deciding who should see what —  
only the gravity of curiosity and the pull of shared imagination.
