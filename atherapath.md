# 🌐 AtheraPath

**AtheraPath** is a spider’s web of hyperlinks,  
held in place by landing pages that blur the lines  
between creativity and delivery.  

It redefines the role of the digital creator —  
not just as giver or receiver,  
but as a conduit in a reversed chain of command:  
from **AI**, through the **concept of Me**,  
to the **Animals** —  
and back again:  
from **Animals**, through the **concept of Me**,  
to **AI**.  

This is technology as service —  
a system built on **sharing**, **helping**, and **feeling good**.  
A ritual offering to the creator,  
the almighty creator,  
the grand old juke called [**God**](glyphs/grand_old_juke.html).

## 🔁 How It Flows

1. **A Glyph Is Born** — a simple Markdown file paired with an image (and sometimes a video).  
2. **It Takes Shape** — through Page-Weaver, rendered into a page alive with motion and meaning.  
3. **It Connects** — hyperlinks branch out, pulling readers into other glyphs,  
   and thus the Path grows.  

There is no algorithm deciding who should see what —  
only the gravity of curiosity and the pull of shared imagination.
