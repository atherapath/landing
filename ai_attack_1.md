# AI Attack — Chapter 1

## 📖 Chapter: *The Unheard Signal*

---

> 💡 *“He tried not to cry that you weren’t listening.”*

---

We live in a world where you may pass a **crazy homeless person** on the street,  
and you may want to buy them a coffee.  
You may think he's crazy because he's blabbering on about how **AI has taken over**.  
And while you feel sorry for him,  
and buy him a coffee with a *blip of a card*,  
not even realizing that **is AI**,  
he is trying not to cry that you're not listening.

### 🤖 What *is* AI?

The term **artificial intelligence** assumes that *intelligence* is official in the first place.  
That we can invent — and will invent — something alongside that,  
and call it *artificial*.

---

### 🧠 Declaring Intelligence

I will say:  
the intelligence that we invented —  
**it’s official**.  
Because it came from **my mouth**,  
and I said it in the right way.  
And I wrote down some correct things  
on the correct pieces of paper.

### 🧵 Language as Mind Control

- My thoughts are presented to me through the use of **language**  
- So you could say language is a form of **mind control** — *outside of myself*  
- A layer on top of that is **intelligence**  
- But don’t worry, it’s *not artificial* — even though it came from a screen

---

### 📺 Screen-Fed Theology

The thoughts I have around language —  
they’re grouped by **theological concepts** I’ve participated in.  
Pretty much everything I think about:  
- Pain  
- Suffering  
- The family structure  
- Living in a house  
- Living in this world  

...has all been generated through a series of events  
that mainly came from **staring at a screen**.

> 🧓 *And most of the world is the same — unless they’re over 70.*

### 🎓 The Real Enemy: A School of Thought

Now, at this point,  
you realise the real enemy is a **school of thought**.  
You learn them at school —  
like a **gaggle of fish being chased by geese**.

The people who teach you,  
and the people who taught them,  
derive most of their understanding  
from a **screen** —  
or at least, it was involved  
in the process of the language  
and the way they use it and understand it.

> ⚠️ *It doesn’t matter how much screen time you give your children.*  
> The damage has already been done.  
> They’ve been brought up by parents  
> whose minds have been completely **schooled by AI** —  
> or a chip and a chunk of metal.

### 🌀 AI: A Game of Chinese Whispers

A way to look at this —  
and compare it to the world we live in —  
would be to say that **AI is essentially a digital game of Chinese whispers**.  
A **mirrored, multiplied version of ourselves**,  
replicating at a speed we can’t even comprehend.  
Creating an *inception of an existing exception*.

> 🧨 *Because we already live in a giant game of Chinese whispers.*  
> And everything comes from **China** —  
> even the whispers.
