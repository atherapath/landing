## 📖 Chapter 3: *The Screen and the Head*

---

So what that means is:  
most of you are **staring at a screen**.

And that’s where most of you have generated your:

- **Schools of thought**  
- **Way of thinking**  
- **Understanding of the world**  
- And the way it works

All of it —  
from a **head on a body**.

And that’s the only **proof** you have of anything.

### 🕵️‍♂️ The Unverifiable World

You can never verify  
that the person you’re looking at is **indeed that person**.

You can never verify  
that the **time it happened** is the time they say it happened.

You can never verify  
that the **place they say it happened** is the place it actually happened.

You can’t verify **any of it**.

If we already live in a world  
where we *suggest* we understand  
that this technology can do this —  
it’s possibly worth questioning:

> 🧠 *How long has it been going on without our knowledge?*

---

So everything you look at on a screen  
could be **potentially irrelevant** —  
and has been for a long time.

That’s why you hear singing that’s **terrible**,  
and music that’s **terrible**,  
and those people tend to stay at the top.

Has anyone ever **met them**?

You’ll certainly see lots of people  
**swinging about London**,  
and **swunting** about all kinds of places  
claiming to be them.

But people make a lot of money  
being **lookalikes** these days.

So —  
has anyone actually **met them**?  
Does anyone **hang out** with them?

Do these people even **exist**?

Or do we live in a world  
where **lookalikes are getting rewarded**  
off the back of them?

### 🎬 This Is Hollywood

This is what you would now call **Hollywood**.

Now —  
does Hollywood want anyone to understand  
how easy it is to **make videos**?

How easy it is to put **anyone’s head on anyone’s body**?

How easy it is to generate  
any number of things that exist in the **creative world**  
they’ve invented —  
in a matter of **seconds**,  
not minutes.

Years and years and years  
of potentially **research and skill** —  
gone.

So what does that make **Hollywood** look like?
