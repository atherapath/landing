I was thinking about the washed‑up undercover military alcoholics, or just men of a certain age — mainly my age — who haven’t really got any wars to fight. Trained to a certain level, trained to graft or fight all day long.  

Now you need to keep those people interested if you want to control them. You need to keep those kinds of people involved in something that doesn’t really exist — the Chinese whisper, the alleged secure need for certain things and certain people, even though nobody cares. There are so many local likes, so many faces, that alleged celebrities can walk around in broad daylight and nobody cares.  

So you’ve got a situation where there are potentially a lot of angry men, strong men, men who can influence physical standpoints and agendas, being controlled and manipulated in a subliminal world. Most of them not getting rewarded for it, painted with the illusion that they’re helping, but they don’t really get anything or recognition for it because it’s all a big secret.  

This is a billion‑dollar industry in itself. The police get involved, the ambulance gets involved, politicians get followed around. Government‑endorsed programming doing the same thing, even though everyone knows politicians aren’t making decisions, everyone knows nothing they talk about on TV ever happens, everyone knows it, no one cares. But the police are still following them around.
